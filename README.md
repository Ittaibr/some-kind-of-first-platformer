This is my first Godot project that is not based on any tutorial or anykind of exsisting code! :) 
The main purpose of this project is to learn how to use the engine and its workflow.
The game is a 2d platformer with the main focus on the character's movment. 
The projocet follows a "Prefer Composition over Inheritance" paradigm and contains a finite state machine for the player charater and the enemy character.
I wrote most of the code here in the span of a few days and sadly had other things to do so I reguraly added some small snippets of code.

Here are some videos of the game:
